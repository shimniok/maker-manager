I build hobby electronics kits. I needed a way to keep track of my parts inventory, BOMs for each project, and determine how much of each part to order to build the next batch. Using a spreadsheet sucked so I created this web-based application.

Built on Linux Mint 14, PHP5, MySQL 5.5.29, tested with Firefox 23

Still in ALPHA meaning it needs a lot of work before it can be deployed on the internet in any fashion.
